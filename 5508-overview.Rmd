  + Use character, number, and date functions in SELECT statements
  + Learn different types of single-row functions.
    + Character
    + Number

    + Conversion
    + General
+ Please note that a few of the single row functions in the videos are not available for SQLite or are slight variations. For a list of SQL single-row functions, please look [here](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html). Here are some functions not available in SQLite.
  + The case conversion function, initcap.
  + The character conversion functions concat, lpad, or rpad are (but there is an alternative for concat (Links to an external site.)).
  + The number functions mod or trunc (but there is an alternative for mod (Links to an external site.)).
  + The general functions, nvl and decode.
  + SQLite has a slightly different approach (Links to an external site.) for displaying and manipulating dates. None of these issues will affect any of the homework exercises.
  
### Data

+ No new data tables.

+ HW07a, .
  + Your homework
    + Round the value 29.526 to two decimal places.
    + Truncate the value 29.526 to zero decimal places.
    + Calculate the remainder of the value 2500 after it is divided by 500
    + Put your code and output in a single pdf file
  + Please note that if you use Oracle, you will need the code "from dual" as part of your query. That code is not needed for SQLite. Also, if you are using SQLite, there is no truncate function, but if you subtract 0.5 before rounding, you get the same answer as truncation. SQLite also uses the % operator to compute remainders. So 20 % 8 will produce a value of 4.
