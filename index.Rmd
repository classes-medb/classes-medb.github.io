This website provides information about the courses that Steve Simon teaches at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. All of these classes start with the four letters MEDB, whose meaning has been lost to antiquity.

All of the information on this website and as well as the assignment, code, and handouts for these classes are included in a [github repository](https://github.com/umkcmedb).

So far, the only class on this repository is MEDB 5507, Introduction to SAS. Other classes will be added soon.

There are five modules associated with MEDB 5507.
