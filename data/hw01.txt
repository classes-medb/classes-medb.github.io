### Assignment

1. Find an example of a SAS code on the web that includes a documentation header. Any code is fine, except code produced by SAS Institute itself. This could be a complete SAS program, a program fragment, or a macro. Look at the comment section at the very top of the program--anything preceding the first line of SAS code. Summarize the key elements that are included in these comments. Is there anything missing from the documentation that you would have liked to see? Include the link to the original web page where you found the SAS code.

If you are having trouble finding SAS code on the web, here are a few resources.
